Fake News Detection – Built an NLP model using TF-IDF vectorization and PassiveAggressiveClassifier, achieving high accuracy in classifying real vs. fake news.
# 📰 Fake News Detection Project

## 📌 Overview

This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to classify news articles as **REAL** or **FAKE**. The model helps detect misinformation by analyzing text data and predicting the authenticity of content.

## ⚙️ Features

* Data preprocessing and cleaning (removing stopwords, punctuation, etc.)
* **TF-IDF Vectorization** for feature extraction
* Trained **PassiveAggressiveClassifier** for classification
* Model evaluation using accuracy score and confusion matrix
* End-to-end Jupyter Notebook implementation

---

## 📊 Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **Pandas, NumPy**
* **Scikit-learn**
* **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (for visualization)
